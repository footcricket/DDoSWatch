# DDoSWatch üö®üåê  

A robust **DDoS Protection System** for cloud-hosted websites, utilizing machine learning and cloud infrastructure like **AWS** to detect and mitigate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.  


## üìÑ Project Overview  

DDoSWatch is a **cloud-based DDoS protection system** that uses **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection and integrates with **AWS services** such as Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, and CloudWatch to detect and mitigate attacks in real time.  

The system also includes traffic simulation using **Apache JMeter** to create realistic attack scenarios for evaluating its effectiveness.  


## üîß Features  

- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects abnormal traffic patterns using Isolation Forest.  
- **Real-Time Mitigation**: Employs AWS Auto Scaling and Load Balancing to mitigate attacks.  
- **Traffic Simulation**: Simulates network traffic with JMeter to test system performance.  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on AWS to handle traffic spikes during potential DDoS attacks.  
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Uses AWS CloudWatch for continuous monitoring and alerting.  


## üèóÔ∏è Agile Development Process  

This project was developed using the Agile Scrum methodology. Our team divided the work into four focused sprints, each addressing key phases of development, ensuring iterative progress and team collaboration. All tasks and user stories were tracked using **Microsoft Planner**.  

### üöÄ Sprint Overview  

#### **Sprint 1: Project Initialization and AWS Setup**  
- Set up the **AWS environment**, including **EC2 instances**, **Auto Scaling**, and **Load Balancer** configurations.  
- Ensured seamless SSH connectivity and system environment preparation.  

#### **Sprint 2: Traffic Simulation and Data Collection**  
- Configured **Apache JMeter** to simulate real-world traffic, including benign and DDoS attack scenarios.  
- Generated and logged network traffic data (`traffic-data.csv`) to serve as input for anomaly detection models.  

#### **Sprint 3: Anomaly Detection Implementation**  
- Developed the **Isolation Forest-based anomaly detection script** (`anomaly_detection.py`) to identify traffic irregularities.  
- Visualized results by generating **anomalies plot** (`anomalies_plot.png`) to validate the model's effectiveness.  

#### **Sprint 4: Performance Testing and Integration**  
- Conducted performance tests using JMeter to evaluate system scalability under attack conditions.  
- Integrated **CloudWatch alarms** for monitoring and configured traffic alerts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation  

### Prerequisites  

- Python 3.x  
- AWS account with the required permissions (IAM for CloudWatch, EC2, etc.)  
- Apache JMeter installed for traffic simulation.  

### Installation Steps  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ParthG26/DDoSWatch.git  
   cd DDoSWatch  
   ```  

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:  
   ```bash  
   python3 -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```  

3. Install the required Python dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  


## üñ•Ô∏è Usage  

Run the following scripts for each function:  

### 1. Anomaly Detection  
```bash  
python "C:\Users\SHAURYA\OneDrive\Desktop\SEM 8 Major Project\DDoSWatch\scripts\anomaly_detection.py"  
```  

- **Input**: `traffic-data.csv` located in the `scripts` folder.  
- **Output**: Anomalies detected and visualized in `anomalies_plot.png` under the `output` folder.  

### 2. Traffic Data Simulation  
```bash  
python "C:\Users\SHAURYA\OneDrive\Desktop\SEM 8 Major Project\DDoSWatch\scripts\generate_traffic_data.py"  
```  

- Generates simulated traffic data, saved as `traffic-data.csv` in the `scripts` folder.
