## üìÑ Project Overview  

DDoSWatch is a **cloud-based DDoS protection system** that uses **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection and integrates with **AWS services** such as Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, and CloudWatch to detect and mitigate attacks in real time.  

The system also includes traffic simulation using **Apache JMeter** to create realistic attack scenarios for evaluating its effectiveness.  

---

## üîß Features  

- **Anomaly Detection**: Detects abnormal traffic patterns using Isolation Forest.  
- **Real-Time Mitigation**: Employs AWS Auto Scaling and Load Balancing to mitigate attacks.  
- **Traffic Simulation**: Simulates network traffic with JMeter to test system performance.  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on AWS to handle traffic spikes during potential DDoS attacks.  
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Uses AWS CloudWatch for continuous monitoring and alerting.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation  

### Prerequisites  

- Python 3.x  
- AWS account with the required permissions (IAM for CloudWatch, EC2, etc.)  
- Apache JMeter installed for traffic simulation.  

### Installation Steps  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ParthG26/DDoSWatch.git  
   cd DDoSWatch  
   ```  

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:  
   ```bash  
   python3 -m venv venv  
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate  
   ```  

3. Install the required Python dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage  

Run the following scripts for each function:  

### 1. Anomaly Detection  
```bash  
python "C:\Users\SHAURYA\OneDrive\Desktop\SEM 8 Major Project\DDoSWatch\scripts\anomaly_detection.py"  
```  

- **Input**: `traffic-data.csv` located in the `scripts` folder.  
- **Output**: Anomalies detected and visualized in `anomalies_plot.png` under the `output` folder.  

### 2. Traffic Data Simulation  
```bash  
python "C:\Users\SHAURYA\OneDrive\Desktop\SEM 8 Major Project\DDoSWatch\scripts\generate_traffic_data.py"  
```  

- Generates simulated traffic data, saved as `traffic-data.csv` in the `scripts` folder.

## üîß JMeter Configuration  

**JMeter Test Plan File**:  
- Path: `"\DDoSWatch\View Results Tree.jmx"`  

### Configuration Details  

1. **Thread Group**:  
   - Number of threads (users): `2000`.  
   - Ramp-up period: `60 seconds`.  
   - Loop count: Continuous traffic simulation.  

2. **HTTP Request Sampler**:  
   - Endpoint: AWS-hosted sample web service.  
   - Traffic includes a mix of legitimate and attack requests.  

3. **Listeners**:  
   - **Summary Report**: Captures key metrics like response times and error rates.  
   - **Graphs**: For visualizing traffic and attack patterns in real time.
