## 📄 Project Overview

DDoSWatch is a **cloud-based DDoS protection system** that leverages machine learning algorithms like **Isolation Forest** and **AWS services** (Auto Scaling, Load Balancing, and CloudWatch) to detect and mitigate attacks in real-time. The system ensures high availability and smooth user experience for cloud-hosted websites.

---

## 🔧 Features

- **DDoS Attack Detection** using machine learning-based anomaly detection.
- **Real-time Mitigation** using **AWS Auto Scaling** and **Load Balancing**.
- **Traffic Simulation** with **JMeter** to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
- **AWS Integration**: Seamless integration with AWS services for scalable DDoS defense.
- **Customizable**: Ability to configure and test different attack scenarios.
